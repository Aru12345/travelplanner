# NomadConnect

Welcome to Nomad Connect, a project blending travel and technology.Using Rapid API's Nomad Connect Data,Google Maps API, and a robust JSON server backend this applcation allows digital nomads to view best cities to live in.

# User Story

As a user...

- I want to view all the cities and their information (air quality,cost of living etc).
- I want to add a city I like to my Journal or delete it and plan my trips.
- I want to be able to view the city pins on the map.

# Futue Additions

I plan on building a comparison tool so that users can compare two or more cities and determine which  better fits their interest.
